Smart Portfolio Manager: Decentralized Asset Allocation and Risk Management
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

SmartFolio is a **Clarity smart contract** designed to implement a decentralized, automated portfolio management system. It provides comprehensive functionalities for asset allocation, dynamic rebalancing, and robust risk management across multiple investment strategies. Built on the Stacks blockchain, this contract ensures secure fund management, transparent access controls, and a full audit trail for all portfolio actions.

* * * * *

üöÄ Features
-----------

-   **Decentralized Portfolio Creation:** Users can create and own their investment portfolios, tailored to specific strategies.

-   **Dynamic Asset Allocation:** Supports various asset types and implements advanced, dynamic algorithms for asset allocation, demonstrated by the `optimize-portfolio-dynamic` function.

-   **Automated Rebalancing:** Includes mechanisms to check for and execute portfolio rebalancing when holdings drift from target allocations, utilizing a configurable `MIN-REBALANCE-THRESHOLD`.

-   **Comprehensive Risk Management:** Enforces strict risk constraints, including a `MAX-SINGLE-ASSET-WEIGHT` limit (50%) and strategy-specific maximum drawdown (`max-drawdown`).

-   **Strategy Configuration:** Allows for the definition and customization of multiple investment strategies with different risk profiles and rebalancing frequencies.

-   **Secure Access Controls:** Utilizes a detailed `user-permissions` map to manage administrative, asset management, and portfolio creation rights.

-   **Fee Structure:** Defines clear `MANAGEMENT-FEE-BP` (2%) and `PERFORMANCE-FEE-BP` (2%) for service sustainability, tracked via `fee-accounts`.

üìù Functions
------------

### Private Functions

Private functions handle internal logic, validation, and complex calculations. Note that some are currently simplified (`has-permission`, `calculate-portfolio-value`, `needs-rebalancing`) and require integration with external price feeds and more sophisticated logic in a production environment.

-   `(validate-allocation (portfolio-id uint) (total-percentage uint))`

    -   **Purpose:** Ensures the sum of all target asset allocations for a portfolio is within an acceptable range (95% to 100% of basis points).

    -   **Errors:** `u1001` (Max 100%), `u1002` (Min 95%).

-   `(has-permission (user principal) (permission (string-ascii 32)))`

    -   **Purpose:** Checks if a given user principal holds a specific administrative or management permission. *Currently simplified to only check for `CONTRACT-OWNER`.*

    -   **Return:** `(ok (is-eq user CONTRACT-OWNER))`.

-   `(calculate-portfolio-value (portfolio-id uint))`

    -   **Purpose:** Calculates the real-time total value of a portfolio. *Currently simplified to return `u0`.*

-   `(needs-rebalancing (portfolio-id uint))`

    -   **Purpose:** Determines if a portfolio's current holdings have deviated enough from their targets to necessitate a rebalance. *Currently simplified to return `(ok true)`.*

### Public Functions

Public functions expose the core functionality of the portfolio manager to users and other contracts.

#### Core Management

-   `(initialize-contract)`

    -   **Purpose:** Initializes the contract by setting the default, full permissions for the `CONTRACT-OWNER`.

    -   **Pre-conditions:** Only callable by the `CONTRACT-OWNER` (checked with `u1005`).

-   `(add-asset (asset-id uint) (symbol (string-utf8 12)) (decimals uint) (contract-address principal))`

    -   **Purpose:** Registers a new asset (token contract) into the `asset-registry`.

    -   **Pre-conditions:** Requires `"manage-assets"` permission and the `asset-id` must be less than `MAX-ASSETS`.

-   `(create-strategy (strategy-id uint) (name (string-utf8 32)) (risk-level uint) (rebalance-frequency uint) (max-drawdown uint))`

    -   **Purpose:** Defines a new investment strategy configuration.

    -   **Pre-conditions:** Requires `"admin"` permission, `strategy-id` less than `MAX-STRATEGIES`, and `risk-level` between `u1` and `u5`.

#### Portfolio Operations

-   `(create-portfolio (name (string-utf8 64)) (strategy-id uint))`

    -   **Purpose:** Creates a new portfolio, increments the `portfolio-counter`, and stores the metadata.

    -   **Pre-conditions:** Requires `"create-portfolio"` permission.

    -   **Post-conditions:** Returns the new `portfolio-id`.

-   `(set-allocation-targets (portfolio-id uint) (asset-id uint) (target-percentage uint))`

    -   **Purpose:** Sets the desired allocation percentage (in basis points) for a specific asset within a portfolio.

    -   **Pre-conditions:** Requires `CONTRACT-OWNER` status (checked with `u1013`) and `target-percentage` must not exceed `MAX-SINGLE-ASSET-WEIGHT` (5000 basis points).

-   `(execute-rebalance (portfolio-id uint))`

    -   **Purpose:** Triggers the process of buying/selling assets to bring the portfolio holdings back to the target allocations. *Currently simplified.*

    -   **Pre-conditions:** Requires `CONTRACT-OWNER` status (checked with `u1016`).

#### Advanced Optimization

-   `(optimize-portfolio-dynamic (portfolio-id uint) (risk-tolerance uint) (time-horizon uint) (volatility-factor uint))`

    -   **Purpose:** Implements a sophisticated, **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)-inspired** algorithm to calculate *new* risk-adjusted asset allocation targets.

    -   **Logic:** It computes an `optimization-factor` based on user inputs:

        -   **Risk Tolerance:** Adjusts up for higher tolerance ($\ge 3 \rightarrow 110\%$) and down for lower tolerance ($\rightarrow 90\%$).

        -   **Time Horizon:** Adjusts up for longer horizons ($\ge 365 \text{ days} \rightarrow 105\%$) and down for shorter ones ($\rightarrow 95\%$).

        -   **Volatility Factor:** Adjusts down for higher volatility ($\ge 5000 \text{BP} \rightarrow 80\%$) and up for lower volatility ($\rightarrow 120\%$).

    -   The `optimization-factor` is then applied to base target allocations for assets u1, u2, and u3, constrained by the `MAX-SINGLE-ASSET-WEIGHT` and a minimum target of `u100` (1%).

    -   **Pre-conditions:** Requires `CONTRACT-OWNER` status (checked with `u1020`).

    -   **Errors:** `u1025` if the total optimized allocation is less than the 95% threshold.
